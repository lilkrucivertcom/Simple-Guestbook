# 📚Simple Guestbook📚

## 📒What is it?
a simple php website that serves a guestbook for minimal websites

## ⚙️How does it work?
it operates on txt files, that's why it doesn't need to be hooked up to any database

## 👺What about spammers?
it has a built in protection and only allows one post an hour per IP

## 🕵️‍♂️What about posters privacy?
the script automatically hashes the IPs so even if someone decides to access the txt file they will only see hashes

## 🙄Who is it made for?
it is made for people that own minimal websites who want to keep it JavaScript free or don't want to set-up a database

## ⚙️How to set this up?
This is very simple! Create a folder called ```guestbook``` in you main webpage folder. Put the files from this repo in the folder you just created. That's it, now you can access it going to ```yourdomain.example.whatever/guestbook```. Just make sure you hosting supports php.
